# Sriracha-Quest


The decade long Sriracha-War has brought countless losses. It looks like the ketchup and mayo soliders could claim dominance over the battlefield in the best "side sauce". The Sriracha was forced to flee, untraceable and forever gone. In reminiscence the people are holding on to the vanishing memory of its sweet and spicy aftertaste, in denial to the reality, that the actual sauce is forever history. But really forever history?

One brave bird solider simply does not accept this new reality. Determined to bring back sriracha it is willing to face the deadly threats of ketchup and mayo. Making the quest to collect the right ingredients despite of all dangers their life's mission. It is up to you to guide and protect this brave bird, to safe the people's pleasure of spiciness.
